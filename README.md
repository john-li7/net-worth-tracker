# Track-it
Track-it is a net worth tracker to record account balances with a line graph visualizer of all recorded snapshots. 

## Getting started

Fork and clone Track-it.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project to store the MongoDB database connection string.

```
mongoURI='<MongoDB database connection string>'
```


Install dependencies and compile the files into a bundle.

```
npm i
npm run build
```


After installation is complete, run the server.

```
npm run start
```
